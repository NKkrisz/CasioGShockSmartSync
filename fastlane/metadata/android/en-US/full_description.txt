Note: We now support the B2100 series of G-Shock watches!

I think we can do better than the official G-Shock Connected App! This app provides the following extra features:

- Sets watch's reminders from Google Calendar
- Automatically sets correct timezone when travelling. No need to switch between Word Time and Home time
- Use your watch to trigger actions on your phone remotely, like taking pictures, dialling a phone number, etc.
- Auto-configure most watch settings from phone's configuration.
- Phone's alarms can be synced with watch's alarms.
- Super fast connection time: 3.5 seconds vs 12 seconds for the official app.

Supported Watches
=================
G(M)W-5600, G(M)W-5000, GA-B2100, GST-B500, MSG-B100, G-B001, GBD-800 (Partial support), MRG-B5000, GCW-B5000

Setting Time
============
The local time can be set from the main screen by pressing the Send to Watch 
button next to the current time display. The app uses your current location to 
get the local lime. You can then set the watch time accordingly, without having 
to change your World Time selection on the watch.

This screen also shows your Home Time location and battery level.

Alarms
======
The B5600/B5000/B2100 watches have 5 alarms and a Signal or chime setting. They are first read
from the watch, and displayed in the app. The alarms can be updated by pressing 
on the time display of each alarm. A dialog will appear which allows you to 
select the time.

Once the alarms have been set, you can send them to the watch, or send them to 
the Alarm Clock app on the phone. Unfortunately, there is currently no way to 
read the alarms from the AlarmClock app programmatically, so we cannot set the 
watch alarms from this app. However, we can set the Alarm Clock app with the 
watch's alarms.

Events
======
This screen displays Events from your Google Calendar and allows you to send 
these events to the watch's reminders.

Events could be one time, repeating daily, weekly, monthly or yearly, or some complex period
such as every second Thursday of the month. Not all event types can be supported on the watch, but this app
attempts to adopt the calendar events to the watch as much as possible. The 
only not supported event types are daily and complex events, such as every
second Thursday of the month. Events occurring number of times are simulated on the watch with
a start and end date, matching the event start time, count and frequency.
In case the calendar event cannot be adopted to a watch reminder, the app
will display the event as Incompatible. Only future events and recurring
events which have not expired are displayed.

The watch only supports all-day reminders. However, if the Google calendar 
event has a specific time, it will still be used as a day reminder on the watch.

Actions
=======
The selected actions are run when the user short-presses the lower-right watch 
button from disconnected mode (initial screen).

Using these actions, the watch acts like a remote control for your phone.

Where are my World Cities?
==========================
Using an app to manually swap between Home Time and World Time is a bit silly.
Your phone already knows where you are. When setting time, this app will also
set the Home Time, Timezone and DST state to your current location.
So when travelling to another timezone, just set time and you are good to go.

Build Your Own App
==================
For those who want to build their own Android app for interfacing with the G-Shock 5000/5600/B2100 watches,
I have also created an API (library) project here: https://github.com/izivkov/GShockAPI.
