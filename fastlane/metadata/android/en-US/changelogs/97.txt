- Implemented the Find Phone function, by long-pressing the LOWER-RIGHT button (FIND should appear on the watch's display).
The phone will stop playing sound once it is picked up, or after 30 seconds.

- Fixed a wrong battery level display on the Time Screen. It works with my two watches, but we need more testing, so please post a messages here if works or not for you.

- Now also show the temperature of the watch, bellow the battery indicator.
